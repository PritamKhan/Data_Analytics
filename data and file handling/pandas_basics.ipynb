         "### Pandas version checks\n\n- [x] I have checked that this issue has not already been reported.\n\n- [x] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [latest version](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/whatsnew/index.html) of pandas.\n\n- [ ] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [main branch](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/getting_started/install.html#installing-the-development-version-of-pandas) of pandas.\n\n\n### Reproducible Example\n\n```python\nimport pandas\n\ndf1 = pandas.DataFrame()\nboolean_series = pandas.Series(dtype=bool)\ndf1[boolean_series]\n# Empty DataFrame\n# Columns: []\n# Index: []\n\ndf2 = pandas.DataFrame(index=[0, 1])\ndf2[boolean_series]\n# IndexingError: Unalignable boolean Series provided as indexer (index of the boolean Series and of the indexed object do not match).\n```\n\n### Issue Description\n\nTrying to use an empty boolean Series to select on an empty DataFrame that has an index results in an error.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI would expect to return an empty DataFrame. The expectation might make more sense with an example.\n\n```\nimport pandas\n\ndf1 = pandas.DataFrame(['a', 'b'], index = [0, 1])\ndf1[df1.duplicated()]\n# Empty DataFrame\n# Columns: [0]\n# Index: []\n\ndf2 = pandas.DataFrame(index = [0, 1])\ndf2[df2.duplicated()]\n# IndexingError: Unalignable boolean Series provided as indexer (index of the boolean Series and of the indexed object do not match).\n```\n\nBoth of these DataFrames have no duplicate values, but only one results in an error. It would be nice not to require a test for this special case and just get an empty DataFrame as the result since an empty DataFrame does not contain any duplicates. \n\nI looked into this a little bit because I thought maybe the .duplicated method just needed to have the empty Series also return the index, but it is not possible, as far as I can tell, to create a Series with an index but no values like you can with a DataFrame. If you try, the values are set to some default. In the case for bool it is True. I think the selection code would have to check for an empty Series before trying to use the index and return an empty DataFrame. If I am investigating this correctly, it looks like in pandas/core/frame.py in the ._getitem_bool_array method you could add a case to the if chain at the top. Something like: \n\n```\nif isinstance(key, Series) and key.empty:\n    return self._take_with_is_copy(Index([]), axis=0)\n```\n\n### Installed Versions\n\n<details>\n\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\n------------------\ncommit                : 0691c5cf90477d3503834d983f69350f250a6ff7\npython                : 3.10.5\npython-bits           : 64\nOS                    : Windows\nOS-release            : 10\nVersion               : 10.0.19045\nmachine               : AMD64\nprocessor             : Intel64 Family 6 Model 158 Stepping 12, GenuineIntel\nbyteorder             : little\nLC_ALL                : None\nLANG                  : en\nLOCALE                : English_United States.1252\n\npandas                : 2.2.3\nnumpy                 : 1.24.4\npytz                  : 2022.1\ndateutil              : 2.8.2\npip                   : 25.0.1\nCython                : 3.0.11\nsphinx                : 5.1.1\nIPython               : 8.21.0\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\nbs4                   : None\nblosc                 : None\nbottleneck            : None\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\nfastparquet           : None\nfsspec                : None\nhtml5lib              : 1.1\nhypothesis            : None\ngcsfs                 : None\njinja2                : None\nlxml.etree            : 4.9.1\nmatplotlib            : None\nnumba                 : None\nnumexpr               : None\nodfpy                 : None\nopenpyxl              : 3.1.4\npandas_gbq            : None\npsycopg2              : None\npymysql               : None\npyarrow               : 19.0.1\npyreadstat            : None\npytest                : None\npython-calamine       : None\npyxlsb                : None\ns3fs                  : None\nscipy                 : None\nsqlalchemy            : 2.0.9\ntables                : None\ntabulate              : 0.9.0\nxarray                : None\nxlrd                  : None\nxlsxwriter            : 3.2.0\nzstandard             : None\ntzdata                : 2024.1\nqtpy                  : 2.4.1\npyqt5                 : None\n\n</details>\n",

This is problematic, as the input series cannot necessarily be controlled beforehand, and if there's any actual non-NaT value, the comparison works. The Series `dtype` values are the same in both cases, which would make me expect that the rest of the behaviour is the same too.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nIn the above code, I would expect it to return:\n\n```python\n0    False\n1    False\ndtype: bool\n```\n\n### Installed Versions\n\n<details>\n\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\n------------------\ncommit                : 0691c5cf90477d3503834d983f69350f250a6ff7\npython                : 3.10.16\npython-bits           : 64\nOS                    : Darwin\nOS-release            : 24.3.0\nVersion               : Darwin Kernel Version 24.3.0: Thu Jan  2 20:24:16 PST 2025; root:xnu-11215.81.4~3/RELEASE_ARM64_T6000\nmachine               : arm64\nprocessor             : arm\nbyteorder             : little\nLC_ALL                : None\nLANG                  : en_GB.UTF-8\nLOCALE                : en_GB.UTF-8\n\npandas                : 2.2.3\nnumpy                 : 1.26.4\npytz                  : 2025.2\ndateutil              : 2.9.0.post0\npip                   : None\nCython                : None\nsphinx                : None\nIPython               : 8.34.0\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\nbs4                   : None\nblosc                 : None\nbottleneck            : None\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\nfastparquet           : None\nfsspec                : 2025.3.0\nhtml5lib              : None\nhypothesis            : 6.130.4\ngcsfs                 : None\njinja2                : 3.1.6\nlxml.etree            : None\nmatplotlib            : 3.10.1\nnumba                 : None\nnumexpr               : None\nodfpy                 : None\nopenpyxl              : None\npandas_gbq            : 0.28.0\npsycopg2              : None\npymysql               : None\npyarrow               : 15.0.2\npyreadstat            : None\npytest                : 8.3.5\npython-calamine       : None\npyxlsb                : None\ns3fs                  : 2025.3.0\nscipy                 : None\nsqlalchemy            : 2.0.39\ntables                : None\ntabulate              : None\nxarray                : None\nxlrd                  : None\nxlsxwriter            : None\nzstandard             : None\ntzdata                : 2025.2\nqtpy                  : None\npyqt5                 : None\n\n</details>\n",

However, it is not.\nassert period_label_1 == period_label_2\n```\n\n### Issue Description\n\nLet's imagine you have a column with dates:\n```python\ndates = pd.date_range(start=pd.to_datetime(\"2018-01-01\"), end=pd.to_datetime(\"2018-01-31\"))\n```\n```\nDatetimeIndex(['2018-01-01', '2018-01-02', '2018-01-03', '2018-01-04',\n                ....               \n               '2018-01-29', '2018-01-30', '2018-01-31'],\n              dtype='datetime64[ns]', freq='D')\n```\n\nWe want to convert them into a week period, with each date replaced with the period label. We will use the default frequency `W`, with each date replaced with the period ending on the preceding Sunday:\n| dates      | Expected Week Period |\n|------------|----------------------|\n| 2018-01-01 | 2018-01-07           |\n| 2018-01-02 | 2018-01-07           |\n| 2018-01-03 | 2018-01-07           |\n| ...        | ...                  |\n| 2018-01-29 | 2018-02-04           |\n| 2018-01-30 | 2018-02-04           |\n| 2018-01-31 | 2018-02-04           |\n\nLet's create a `PeriodIndex` where each date value is replaced with `Period` object\n```python\nperiod_index = dates.to_period(freq=\"W\")\n```\n```\nPeriodIndex(['2018-01-01/2018-01-07', '2018-01-01/2018-01-07',\n             ...\n             '2018-01-29/2018-02-04'],\n            dtype='period[W-SUN]')\n```\n\nThen we would like to take only one day instead of `PeriodIndex`. The simplest solution is to convert the column type into `datetime64[ns]`:\n```python\nperiod_index.astype(\"datetime64[ns]\")[0]\n```\nHowever, an unexpected day appears. Instead of period end `2018-01-07`, pandas returns period start:\n```\nTimestamp('2018-01-01 00:00:00')\n```\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nThere is a trick that helps to fix this behavior. Firstly, we convert the `Period` values back to daily frequency and then transform into `datetime64[ns]`:\n```python\nperiod_index.asfreq('D').astype(\"datetime64[ns]\")[0]\n```\n```\nTimestamp('2018-01-07 00:00:00')\n```\n\nSuch behavior should be documented or/and the warning should be raised that direct conversion of the `PeriodIndex` into `\"datetime64[ns]\"` is not aligned with expected behavior.\n\n### Installed Versions\n\n<details>\n\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\n------------------\ncommit                : 0691c5cf90477d3503834d983f69350f250a6ff7\npython                : 3.11.7\npython-bits           : 64\nOS                    : Linux\nOS-release            : 5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2\nVersion               : #1 SMP Tue Nov 5 00:21:55 UTC 2024\nmachine               : x86_64\nprocessor             : x86_64\nbyteorder             : little\nLC_ALL                : None\nLANG                  : C.UTF-8\nLOCALE                : en_US.UTF-8\npandas                : 2.2.3\nnumpy                 : 1.26.3\npytz                  : 2025.1\ndateutil              : 2.8.2\npip                   : 23.2.1\nCython                : None\nsphinx                : None\nIPython               : 8.20.0\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\nbs4                   : 4.12.3\nblosc                 : None\nbottleneck            : None\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\nfastparquet           : None\nfsspec                : 2023.12.2\nhtml5lib              : None\nhypothesis            : None\ngcsfs                 : 2023.12.2post1\njinja2                : 3.1.3\nlxml.etree            : None\nmatplotlib            : 3.8.2\nnumba                 : 0.60.0\nnumexpr               : None\nodfpy                 : None\nopenpyxl              : 3.1.2\npandas_gbq            : None\npsycopg2              : None\npymysql               : None\npyarrow               : 14.0.2\npyreadstat            : None\npytest                : 7.4.4\npython-calamine       : None\npyxlsb                : None\ns3fs                  : 2023.12.2\nscipy                 : 1.12.0\nsqlalchemy            : 2.0.29\ntables                : None\ntabulate              : 0.9.0\nxarray                : None\nxlrd                  : None\nxlsxwriter            : None\nzstandard             : None\ntzdata                : 2023.4\nqtpy                  : None\npyqt5                 : None\n\n</details>\n",

         "### Pandas version checks\n\n- [x] I have checked that this issue has not already been reported.\n\n- [x] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [latest version](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/whatsnew/index.html) of pandas.\n\n- [ ] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [main branch](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/getting_started/install.html#installing-the-development-version-of-pandas) of pandas.\n\n\n### Reproducible Example\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\nx = pd.Series([1,2,3,5])\ny = pd.Series([2,3,4])\n\npd.eval(\"(x + y).dropna()\")\n# raises AttributeError: 'BinOp' object has no attribute 'value'\n\n# Note that something like pd.eval(\"(x.dropna() + y)\") works!\n```\n\n### Issue Description\n\nAlso effects other Series methods called on the result of a binary operation, which work well if applied to one operand.\n\nSee also https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/24670\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nShould return a Series of sums with nan values removed. Generally I would expect that it should be possible to apply a Series method to the result of a binary operation as part of an eval expression.\n\n### Installed Versions\n\n<details>\n\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\n------------------\ncommit                : 0691c5cf90477d3503834d983f69350f250a6ff7\npython                : 3.13.2\npython-bits           : 64\nOS                    : Linux\nOS-release            : 6.13.7-arch1-1\nVersion               : #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Thu, 13 Mar 2025 18:12:00 +0000\nmachine               : x86_64\nprocessor             : \nbyteorder             : little\nLC_ALL                : None\nLANG                  : de_DE.UTF-8\nLOCALE                : de_DE.UTF-8\n\npandas                : 2.2.3\nnumpy                 : 2.2.3\npytz                  : 2025.1\ndateutil              : 2.9.0.post0\npip                   : 25.0.1\nCython                : None\nsphinx                : None\nIPython               : 9.0.1\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\nbs4                   : 4.13.3\nblosc                 : None\nbottleneck            : None\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\nfastparquet           : None\nfsspec                : 2025.2.0\nhtml5lib              : None\nhypothesis            : None\ngcsfs                 : None\njinja2                : 3.1.5\nlxml.etree            : 5.3.1\nmatplotlib            : 3.10.1\nnumba                 : None\nnumexpr               : 2.10.2\nodfpy                 : None\nopenpyxl              : None\npandas_gbq            : None\npsycopg2              : None\npymysql               : None\npyarrow               : None\npyreadstat            : None\npytest                : 8.3.5\npython-calamine       : None\npyxlsb                : None\ns3fs                  : None\nscipy                 : 1.15.2\nsqlalchemy            : 2.0.38\ntables                : 3.10.2\ntabulate              : None\nxarray                : 2025.1.2\nxlrd                  : None\nxlsxwriter            : None\nzstandard             : None\ntzdata                : 2025.1\nqtpy                  : None\npyqt5                 : None\n\n</details>\n",

         "### Pandas version checks\n\n- [x] I have checked that this issue has not already been reported.\n\n- [x] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [latest version](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/whatsnew/index.html) of pandas.\n\n- [x] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [main branch](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/getting_started/install.html#installing-the-development-version-of-pandas) of pandas.\n\n\n### Reproducible Example\n\n```python\nUsing `pd.read_csv()` to open an empty CSV file (0-bytes file or single-byte file (EOL character) by VIM) will give the following error:\n\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n  File \"/home/xuancong/anaconda3/lib/python3.11/site-packages/pandas/io/parsers/readers.py\", line 1026, in read_csv\n    return _read(filepath_or_buffer, kwds)\n           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"/home/xuancong/anaconda3/lib/python3.11/site-packages/pandas/io/parsers/readers.py\", line 620, in _read\n    parser = TextFileReader(filepath_or_buffer, **kwds)\n             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"/home/xuancong/anaconda3/lib/python3.11/site-packages/pandas/io/parsers/readers.py\", line 1620, in __init__\n    self._engine = self._make_engine(f, self.engine)\n                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"/home/xuancong/anaconda3/lib/python3.11/site-packages/pandas/io/parsers/readers.py\", line 1898, in _make_engine\n    return mapping[engine](f, **self.options)\n           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"/home/xuancong/anaconda3/lib/python3.11/site-packages/pandas/io/parsers/c_parser_wrapper.py\", line 93, in __init__\n    self._reader = parsers.TextReader(src, **kwds)\n                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"parsers.pyx\", line 581, in pandas._libs.parsers.TextReader.__cinit__\npandas.errors.EmptyDataError: No columns to parse from file\n```\n\n### Issue Description\n\nThe reason of the crash is that there is no columns to parse. However, Pandas does allow dataframes with no columns and no rows, i.e., `pd.DataFrame()` gives an empty DataFrame with no rows and no columns.\n\nThe logic reasoning is that if opening an empty CSV will cause crash, then **opening what kind of CSV file will give rise to an empty DataFrame**? When designing APIs, one fundamental principle is to try to keep a 1-to-1 mapping between input and output (so as to reduce information loss); thus, in this case, it is the mapping between CSV file and dataframe. I do agree that if the CSV does not exist or cannot be read (due to permission), then the call should crash. But if the CSV file is empty, `pd.read_csv()` should give an empty dataframe because empty dataframe does exist. Otherwise, what text should I put into a CSV file so that `pd.read_csv()` will give an empty DataFrame, i.e., `pd.DataFrame()`? Thanks!\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nOpening an empty CSV file should give an empty DataFrame (i.e., pd.DataFrame()):\n```\nEmpty DataFrame\nColumns: []\nIndex: []\n```\n\n### Installed Versions\n\n<details>\n\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\n------------------\ncommit                : 0691c5cf90477d3503834d983f69350f250a6ff7\npython                : 3.11.5\npython-bits           : 64\nOS                    : Linux\nOS-release            : 6.8.0-52-generic\nVersion               : #53~22.04.1-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Wed Jan 15 19:18:46 UTC 2\nmachine               : x86_64\nprocessor             : x86_64\nbyteorder             : little\nLC_ALL                : en_US.UTF-8\nLANG                  : en_US.UTF-8\nLOCALE                : en_US.UTF-8\n\npandas                : 2.2.3\nnumpy                 : 1.26.4\npytz                  : 2023.3.post1\ndateutil              : 2.8.2\npip                   : 25.0.1\nCython                : None\nsphinx                : 5.0.2\nIPython               : 8.15.0\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\nbs4                   : 4.12.2\nblosc                 : None\nbottleneck            : 1.4.0\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\nfastparquet           : None\nfsspec                : 2025.2.0\nhtml5lib              : None\nhypothesis            : None\ngcsfs                 : None\njinja2                : 3.1.2\nlxml.etree            : 4.9.3\nmatplotlib            : 3.8.4\nnumba                 : 0.60.0\nnumexpr               : 2.8.4\nodfpy                 : None\nopenpyxl              : None\npandas_gbq            : None\npsycopg2              : None\npymysql               : None\npyarrow               : 11.0.0\npyreadstat            : None\npytest                : 7.4.0\npython-calamine       : None\npyxlsb                : None\ns3fs                  : None\nscipy                 : 1.14.1\nsqlalchemy            : None\ntables                : 3.9.2\ntabulate              : None\nxarray                : 2023.6.0\nxlrd                  : None\nxlsxwriter            : 3.2.2\nzstandard             : 0.19.0\ntzdata                : 2023.3\nqtpy                  : None\npyqt5                 : None\n\n\n</details>\n",

         "### Feature Type\n\n- [x] Adding new functionality to pandas\n\n- [ ] Changing existing functionality in pandas\n\n- [ ] Removing existing functionality in pandas\n\n\n### Problem Description\n\nI often find myself using the merge_asof function on time series data. The tolerance and allow_exact_matches fields are very useful in filtering data, but it would be very useful to have more granular control over this tolerance. Being able to supply a minimum tolerance in addition to the currently existing maximum tolerance would be very beneficial in giving the user more control over this function.\n\n### Feature Description\n\nA current example for this function is the following:\n\nWe only asof within 10ms between the quote time and the trade time\n    and we exclude exact matches on time. However *prior* data will\n    propagate forward\n\n    >>> pd.merge_asof(\n    ...     trades,\n    ...     quotes,\n    ...     on=\"time\",\n    ...     by=\"ticker\",\n    ...     tolerance=pd.Timedelta(\"10ms\"),\n    ...     allow_exact_matches=False\n    ... )\n                         time ticker   price  quantity     bid     ask\n    0 2016-05-25 13:30:00.023   MSFT   51.95        75     NaN     NaN\n    1 2016-05-25 13:30:00.038   MSFT   51.95       155   51.97   51.98\n    2 2016-05-25 13:30:00.048   GOOG  720.77       100     NaN     NaN\n    3 2016-05-25 13:30:00.048   GOOG  720.92       100     NaN     NaN\n    4 2016-05-25 13:30:00.048   AAPL   98.00       100     NaN     NaN\n\nI am envisining a version where we could have\n\nWe only asof within 10ms between the quote time and the trade time but more than 2ms between the quote time and the trade time and we exclude exact matches on time. However *prior* data will propagate forward\n\n    >>> pd.merge_asof(\n    ...     trades,\n    ...     quotes,\n    ...     on=\"time\",\n    ...     by=\"ticker\",\n    ...     tolerance=pd.Timedelta(\"10ms\"),\n    ...     mininum_tolerance=pd.Timedelta(\"2ms\"),\n    ...     allow_exact_matches=False\n    ... )\n                         time ticker   price  quantity     bid     ask\n    0 2016-05-25 13:30:00.023   MSFT   51.95        75     NaN     NaN\n    1 2016-05-25 13:30:00.038   MSFT   51.95       155   51.97   51.98\n    2 2016-05-25 13:30:00.048   GOOG  720.77       100     NaN     NaN\n    3 2016-05-25 13:30:00.048   GOOG  720.92       100     NaN     NaN\n    4 2016-05-25 13:30:00.048   AAPL   98.00       100     NaN     NaN\n\n\n### Alternative Solutions\n\nAnother solution to this problem to augment the currently existing tolerance argument to accept a single datetimelike object, or a tuple of datetmelike objects which could act as a lower and upper bound, respectively.\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_",

To get them from the csv, we can set the same parameter in read_csv, and the original Numpy array will be returned.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to tests in scripts/tests/test_csv.py to see how this is used.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the original issue for more information on the problem definition.\r\n\r\n",

If the lists have different lengths, then the output doesn't raise an error and is correct.\n\nIn an older version of pandas (1.5.3), it produced a list of same length, but containing repeated casts of string arrays\n```\n<StringArray>\n[\n[\"['t' 'e' 's' 't']\", \"['t' 'e' 's' 't']\", \"['t' 'e' 's' 't']\",\n \"['t' 'e' 's' 't']\"]\n]\nShape: (1, 4), dtype: string\n```\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nSame as pd.array([list('test')]) but with `StringArray` type.\n\n### Installed Versions\n\n<details>\n\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\n------------------\ncommit                : d9cdd2ee5a58015ef6f4d15c7226110c9aab8140\npython                : 3.12.3.final.0\npython-bits           : 64\nOS                    : Windows\nOS-release            : 11\nVersion               : 10.0.22631\nmachine               : AMD64\nprocessor             : Intel64 Family 6 Model 154 Stepping 3, GenuineIntel\nbyteorder             : little\nLC_ALL                : None\nLANG                  : en\nLOCALE                : English_Europe.1252\n\npandas                : 2.2.2\nnumpy                 : 1.26.4\npytz                  : 2024.1\ndateutil              : 2.9.0.post0\nsetuptools            : 75.1.0\npip                   : 24.2\nCython                : None\npytest                : 7.4.4\nhypothesis            : None\nsphinx                : 7.3.7\nblosc                 : None\nfeather               : None\nxlsxwriter            : None\nlxml.etree            : 5.2.1\nhtml5lib              : None\npymysql               : None\npsycopg2              : None\njinja2                : 3.1.4\nIPython               : 8.27.0\npandas_datareader     : None\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\nbs4                   : 4.12.3\nbottleneck            : 1.3.7\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\nfastparquet           : None\nfsspec                : 2024.6.1\ngcsfs                 : None\nmatplotlib            : 3.9.2\nnumba                 : 0.60.0\nnumexpr               : 2.8.7\nodfpy                 : None\nopenpyxl              : 3.1.5\npandas_gbq            : None\npyarrow               : 16.1.0\npyreadstat            : None\npython-calamine       : None\npyxlsb                : None\ns3fs                  : 2024.6.1\nscipy                 : 1.13.1\nsqlalchemy            : 2.0.34\ntables                : 3.10.1\ntabulate              : 0.9.0\nxarray                : 2023.6.0\nxlrd                  : None\nzstandard             : 0.23.0\ntzdata                : 2023.3\nqtpy                  : 2.4.1\npyqt5                 : None\n\n</details>\n",

       "  'body': \"### Pandas version checks\\n\\n- [x] I have checked that this issue has not already been reported.\\n\\n- [x] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [latest version](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/whatsnew/index.html) of pandas.\\n\\n- [ ] I have confirmed this bug exists on the [main branch](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/getting_started/install.html#installing-the-development-version-of-pandas) of pandas.\\n\\n\\n### Reproducible Example\\n\\n```python\\nimport pandas\\n\\ndf1 = pandas.DataFrame()\\nboolean_series = pandas.Series(dtype=bool)\\ndf1[boolean_series]\\n# Empty DataFrame\\n# Columns: []\\n# Index: []\\n\\ndf2 = pandas.DataFrame(index=[0, 1])\\ndf2[boolean_series]\\n# IndexingError: Unalignable boolean Series provided as indexer (index of the boolean Series and of the indexed object do not match).\\n```\\n\\n### Issue Description\\n\\nTrying to use an empty boolean Series to select on an empty DataFrame that has an index results in an error.\\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nI would expect to return an empty DataFrame. The expectation might make more sense with an example.\\n\\n```\\nimport pandas\\n\\ndf1 = pandas.DataFrame(['a', 'b'], index = [0, 1])\\ndf1[df1.duplicated()]\\n# Empty DataFrame\\n# Columns: [0]\\n# Index: []\\n\\ndf2 = pandas.DataFrame(index = [0, 1])\\ndf2[df2.duplicated()]\\n# IndexingError: Unalignable boolean Series provided as indexer (index of the boolean Series and of the indexed object do not match).\\n```\\n\\nBoth of these DataFrames have no duplicate values, but only one results in an error. It would be nice not to require a test for this special case and just get an empty DataFrame as the result since an empty DataFrame does not contain any duplicates. \\n\\nI looked into this a little bit because I thought maybe the .duplicated method just needed to have the empty Series also return the index, but it is not possible, as far as I can tell, to create a Series with an index but no values like you can with a DataFrame. If you try, the values are set to some default. In the case for bool it is True. I think the selection code would have to check for an empty Series before trying to use the index and return an empty DataFrame. If I am investigating this correctly, it looks like in pandas/core/frame.py in the ._getitem_bool_array method you could add a case to the if chain at the top. Something like: \\n\\n```\\nif isinstance(key, Series) and key.empty:\\n    return self._take_with_is_copy(Index([]), axis=0)\\n```\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\n\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\n------------------\\ncommit                : 0691c5cf90477d3503834d983f69350f250a6ff7\\npython                : 3.10.5\\npython-bits           : 64\\nOS                    : Windows\\nOS-release            : 10\\nVersion               : 10.0.19045\\nmachine               : AMD64\\nprocessor             : Intel64 Family 6 Model 158 Stepping 12, GenuineIntel\\nbyteorder             : little\\nLC_ALL                : None\\nLANG                  : en\\nLOCALE                : English_United States.1252\\n\\npandas                : 2.2.3\\nnumpy                 : 1.24.4\\npytz                  : 2022.1\\ndateutil              : 2.8.2\\npip                   : 25.0.1\\nCython                : 3.0.11\\nsphinx                : 5.1.1\\nIPython               : 8.21.0\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\nbs4                   : None\\nblosc                 : None\\nbottleneck            : None\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\nfastparquet           : None\\nfsspec                : None\\nhtml5lib              : 1.1\\nhypothesis            : None\\ngcsfs                 : None\\njinja2                : None\\nlxml.etree            : 4.9.1\\nmatplotlib            : None\\nnumba                 : None\\nnumexpr               : None\\nodfpy                 : None\\nopenpyxl              : 3.1.4\\npandas_gbq            : None\\npsycopg2              : None\\npymysql               : None\\npyarrow               : 19.0.1\\npyreadstat            : None\\npytest                : None\\npython-calamine       : None\\npyxlsb                : None\\ns3fs                  : None\\nscipy                 : None\\nsqlalchemy            : 2.0.9\\ntables                : None\\ntabulate              : 0.9.0\\nxarray                : None\\nxlrd                  : None\\nxlsxwriter            : 3.2.0\\nzstandard             : None\\ntzdata                : 2024.1\\nqtpy                  : 2.4.1\\npyqt5                 : None\\n\\n</details>\\n\",\n",

This is problematic, as the input series cannot necessarily be controlled beforehand, and if there\\'s any actual non-NaT value, the comparison works. The Series `dtype` values are the same in both cases, which would make me expect that the rest of the behaviour is the same too.\\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nIn the above code, I would expect it to return:\\n\\n```python\\n0    False\\n1    False\\ndtype: bool\\n```\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\n\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\n------------------\\ncommit                : 0691c5cf90477d3503834d983f69350f250a6ff7\\npython                : 3.10.16\\npython-bits           : 64\\nOS                    : Darwin\\nOS-release            : 24.3.0\\nVersion               : Darwin Kernel Version 24.3.0: Thu Jan  2 20:24:16 PST 2025; root:xnu-11215.81.4~3/RELEASE_ARM64_T6000\\nmachine               : arm64\\nprocessor             : arm\\nbyteorder             : little\\nLC_ALL                : None\\nLANG                  : en_GB.UTF-8\\nLOCALE                : en_GB.UTF-8\\n\\npandas                : 2.2.3\\nnumpy                 : 1.26.4\\npytz                  : 2025.2\\ndateutil              : 2.9.0.post0\\npip                   : None\\nCython                : None\\nsphinx                : None\\nIPython               : 8.34.0\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\nbs4                   : None\\nblosc                 : None\\nbottleneck            : None\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\nfastparquet           : None\\nfsspec                : 2025.3.0\\nhtml5lib              : None\\nhypothesis            : 6.130.4\\ngcsfs                 : None\\njinja2                : 3.1.6\\nlxml.etree            : None\\nmatplotlib            : 3.10.1\\nnumba                 : None\\nnumexpr               : None\\nodfpy                 : None\\nopenpyxl              : None\\npandas_gbq            : 0.28.0\\npsycopg2              : None\\npymysql               : None\\npyarrow               : 15.0.2\\npyreadstat            : None\\npytest                : 8.3.5\\npython-calamine       : None\\npyxlsb                : None\\ns3fs                  : 2025.3.0\\nscipy                 : None\\nsqlalchemy            : 2.0.39\\ntables                : None\\ntabulate              : None\\nxarray                : None\\nxlrd                  : None\\nxlsxwriter            : None\\nzstandard             : None\\ntzdata                : 2025.2\\nqtpy                  : None\\npyqt5                 : None\\n\\n</details>\\n',\n",

However, it is not.\\nassert period_label_1 == period_label_2\\n```\\n\\n### Issue Description\\n\\nLet\\'s imagine you have a column with dates:\\n```python\\ndates = pd.date_range(start=pd.to_datetime(\"2018-01-01\"), end=pd.to_datetime(\"2018-01-31\"))\\n```\\n```\\nDatetimeIndex([\\'2018-01-01\\', \\'2018-01-02\\', \\'2018-01-03\\', \\'2018-01-04\\',\\n                ....               \\n               \\'2018-01-29\\', \\'2018-01-30\\', \\'2018-01-31\\'],\\n              dtype=\\'datetime64[ns]\\', freq=\\'D\\')\\n```\\n\\nWe want to convert them into a week period, with each date replaced with the period label. We will use the default frequency `W`, with each date replaced with the period ending on the preceding Sunday:\\n| dates      | Expected Week Period |\\n|------------|----------------------|\\n| 2018-01-01 | 2018-01-07           |\\n| 2018-01-02 | 2018-01-07           |\\n| 2018-01-03 | 2018-01-07           |\\n| ...        | ...                  |\\n| 2018-01-29 | 2018-02-04           |\\n| 2018-01-30 | 2018-02-04           |\\n| 2018-01-31 | 2018-02-04           |\\n\\nLet\\'s create a `PeriodIndex` where each date value is replaced with `Period` object\\n```python\\nperiod_index = dates.to_period(freq=\"W\")\\n```\\n```\\nPeriodIndex([\\'2018-01-01/2018-01-07\\', \\'2018-01-01/2018-01-07\\',\\n             ...\\n             \\'2018-01-29/2018-02-04\\'],\\n            dtype=\\'period[W-SUN]\\')\\n```\\n\\nThen we would like to take only one day instead of `PeriodIndex`. The simplest solution is to convert the column type into `datetime64[ns]`:\\n```python\\nperiod_index.astype(\"datetime64[ns]\")[0]\\n```\\nHowever, an unexpected day appears. Instead of period end `2018-01-07`, pandas returns period start:\\n```\\nTimestamp(\\'2018-01-01 00:00:00\\')\\n```\\n\\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nThere is a trick that helps to fix this behavior. Firstly, we convert the `Period` values back to daily frequency and then transform into `datetime64[ns]`:\\n```python\\nperiod_index.asfreq(\\'D\\').astype(\"datetime64[ns]\")[0]\\n```\\n```\\nTimestamp(\\'2018-01-07 00:00:00\\')\\n```\\n\\nSuch behavior should be documented or/and the warning should be raised that direct conversion of the `PeriodIndex` into `\"datetime64[ns]\"` is not aligned with expected behavior.\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\n\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\n------------------\\ncommit                : 0691c5cf90477d3503834d983f69350f250a6ff7\\npython                : 3.11.7\\npython-bits           : 64\\nOS                    : Linux\\nOS-release            : 5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2\\nVersion               : #1 SMP Tue Nov 5 00:21:55 UTC 2024\\nmachine               : x86_64\\nprocessor             : x86_64\\nbyteorder             : little\\nLC_ALL                : None\\nLANG                  : C.UTF-8\\nLOCALE                : en_US.UTF-8\\npandas                : 2.2.3\\nnumpy                 : 1.26.3\\npytz                  : 2025.1\\ndateutil              : 2.8.2\\npip                   : 23.2.1\\nCython                : None\\nsphinx                : None\\nIPython               : 8.20.0\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\nbs4                   : 4.12.3\\nblosc                 : None\\nbottleneck            : None\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\nfastparquet           : None\\nfsspec                : 2023.12.2\\nhtml5lib              : None\\nhypothesis            : None\\ngcsfs                 : 2023.12.2post1\\njinja2                : 3.1.3\\nlxml.etree            : None\\nmatplotlib            : 3.8.2\\nnumba                 : 0.60.0\\nnumexpr               : None\\nodfpy                 : None\\nopenpyxl              : 3.1.2\\npandas_gbq            : None\\npsycopg2              : None\\npymysql               : None\\npyarrow               : 14.0.2\\npyreadstat            : None\\npytest                : 7.4.4\\npython-calamine       : None\\npyxlsb                : None\\ns3fs                  : 2023.12.2\\nscipy                 : 1.12.0\\nsqlalchemy            : 2.0.29\\ntables                : None\\ntabulate              : 0.9.0\\nxarray                : None\\nxlrd                  : None\\nxlsxwriter            : None\\nzstandard             : None\\ntzdata                : 2023.4\\nqtpy                  : None\\npyqt5                 : None\\n\\n</details>\\n',\n",

Generally I would expect that it should be possible to apply a Series method to the result of a binary operation as part of an eval expression.\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\n\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\n------------------\\ncommit                : 0691c5cf90477d3503834d983f69350f250a6ff7\\npython                : 3.13.2\\npython-bits           : 64\\nOS                    : Linux\\nOS-release            : 6.13.7-arch1-1\\nVersion               : #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Thu, 13 Mar 2025 18:12:00 +0000\\nmachine               : x86_64\\nprocessor             : \\nbyteorder             : little\\nLC_ALL                : None\\nLANG                  : de_DE.UTF-8\\nLOCALE                : de_DE.UTF-8\\n\\npandas                : 2.2.3\\nnumpy                 : 2.2.3\\npytz                  : 2025.1\\ndateutil              : 2.9.0.post0\\npip                   : 25.0.1\\nCython                : None\\nsphinx                : None\\nIPython               : 9.0.1\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\nbs4                   : 4.13.3\\nblosc                 : None\\nbottleneck            : None\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\nfastparquet           : None\\nfsspec                : 2025.2.0\\nhtml5lib              : None\\nhypothesis            : None\\ngcsfs                 : None\\njinja2                : 3.1.5\\nlxml.etree            : 5.3.1\\nmatplotlib            : 3.10.1\\nnumba                 : None\\nnumexpr               : 2.10.2\\nodfpy                 : None\\nopenpyxl              : None\\npandas_gbq            : None\\npsycopg2              : None\\npymysql               : None\\npyarrow               : None\\npyreadstat            : None\\npytest                : 8.3.5\\npython-calamine       : None\\npyxlsb                : None\\ns3fs                  : None\\nscipy                 : 1.15.2\\nsqlalchemy            : 2.0.38\\ntables                : 3.10.2\\ntabulate              : None\\nxarray                : 2025.1.2\\nxlrd                  : None\\nxlsxwriter            : None\\nzstandard             : None\\ntzdata                : 2025.1\\nqtpy                  : None\\npyqt5                 : None\\n\\n</details>\\n',\n",

However, Pandas does allow dataframes with no columns and no rows, i.e., `pd.DataFrame()` gives an empty DataFrame with no rows and no columns.\\n\\nThe logic reasoning is that if opening an empty CSV will cause crash, then **opening what kind of CSV file will give rise to an empty DataFrame**? When designing APIs, one fundamental principle is to try to keep a 1-to-1 mapping between input and output (so as to reduce information loss); thus, in this case, it is the mapping between CSV file and dataframe. I do agree that if the CSV does not exist or cannot be read (due to permission), then the call should crash. But if the CSV file is empty, `pd.read_csv()` should give an empty dataframe because empty dataframe does exist. Otherwise, what text should I put into a CSV file so that `pd.read_csv()` will give an empty DataFrame, i.e., `pd.DataFrame()`? Thanks!\\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nOpening an empty CSV file should give an empty DataFrame (i.e., pd.DataFrame()):\\n```\\nEmpty DataFrame\\nColumns: []\\nIndex: []\\n```\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\n\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\n------------------\\ncommit                : 0691c5cf90477d3503834d983f69350f250a6ff7\\npython                : 3.11.5\\npython-bits           : 64\\nOS                    : Linux\\nOS-release            : 6.8.0-52-generic\\nVersion               : #53~22.04.1-Ubuntu SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Wed Jan 15 19:18:46 UTC 2\\nmachine               : x86_64\\nprocessor             : x86_64\\nbyteorder             : little\\nLC_ALL                : en_US.UTF-8\\nLANG                  : en_US.UTF-8\\nLOCALE                : en_US.UTF-8\\n\\npandas                : 2.2.3\\nnumpy                 : 1.26.4\\npytz                  : 2023.3.post1\\ndateutil              : 2.8.2\\npip                   : 25.0.1\\nCython                : None\\nsphinx                : 5.0.2\\nIPython               : 8.15.0\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\nbs4                   : 4.12.2\\nblosc                 : None\\nbottleneck            : 1.4.0\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\nfastparquet           : None\\nfsspec                : 2025.2.0\\nhtml5lib              : None\\nhypothesis            : None\\ngcsfs                 : None\\njinja2                : 3.1.2\\nlxml.etree            : 4.9.3\\nmatplotlib            : 3.8.4\\nnumba                 : 0.60.0\\nnumexpr               : 2.8.4\\nodfpy                 : None\\nopenpyxl              : None\\npandas_gbq            : None\\npsycopg2              : None\\npymysql               : None\\npyarrow               : 11.0.0\\npyreadstat            : None\\npytest                : 7.4.0\\npython-calamine       : None\\npyxlsb                : None\\ns3fs                  : None\\nscipy                 : 1.14.1\\nsqlalchemy            : None\\ntables                : 3.9.2\\ntabulate              : None\\nxarray                : 2023.6.0\\nxlrd                  : None\\nxlsxwriter            : 3.2.2\\nzstandard             : 0.19.0\\ntzdata                : 2023.3\\nqtpy                  : None\\npyqt5                 : None\\n\\n\\n</details>\\n',\n",

However, calling `to_json()` on the same `Series` raises an `OverflowError: Maximum recursion level reached`.\\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nExpected: {\"A\": \"int64\", \"B\": \"int64\"} without error\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\n------------------\\ncommit                : d9cdd2ee5a58015ef6f4d15c7226110c9aab8140\\npython                : 3.11.11.final.0\\npython-bits           : 64\\nOS                    : Darwin\\nOS-release            : 24.3.0\\nVersion               : Darwin Kernel Version 24.3.0: Thu Jan  2 20:24:23 PST 2025; root:xnu-11215.81.4~3/RELEASE_ARM64_T6020\\nmachine               : arm64\\nprocessor             : arm\\nbyteorder             : little\\nLC_ALL                : None\\nLANG                  : zh_CN.UTF-8\\nLOCALE                : zh_CN.UTF-8\\n\\npandas                : 2.2.2\\nnumpy                 : 1.26.4\\npytz                  : 2022.6\\ndateutil              : 2.8.2\\nsetuptools            : 75.6.0\\npip                   : 24.3.1\\nCython                : None\\npytest                : 8.2.2\\nhypothesis            : None\\nsphinx                : None\\nblosc                 : None\\nfeather               : None\\nxlsxwriter            : None\\nlxml.etree            : 4.9.3\\nhtml5lib              : 1.1\\npymysql               : None\\npsycopg2              : None\\njinja2                : 3.1.2\\nIPython               : 8.11.0\\npandas_datareader     : None\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\nbs4                   : 4.12.2\\nbottleneck            : None\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\nfastparquet           : None\\nfsspec                : 2023.12.2\\ngcsfs                 : None\\nmatplotlib            : 3.8.3\\nnumba                 : 0.58.1\\nnumexpr               : None\\nodfpy                 : None\\nopenpyxl              : 3.1.2\\npandas_gbq            : None\\npyarrow               : 14.0.1\\npyreadstat            : None\\npython-calamine       : None\\npyxlsb                : None\\ns3fs                  : None\\nscipy                 : 1.12.0\\nsqlalchemy            : None\\ntables                : None\\ntabulate              : None\\nxarray                : None\\nxlrd                  : 2.0.1\\nzstandard             : None\\ntzdata                : 2024.1\\nqtpy                  : None\\npyqt5                 : None\\n',\n",

The tolerance and allow_exact_matches fields are very useful in filtering data, but it would be very useful to have more granular control over this tolerance. Being able to supply a minimum tolerance in addition to the currently existing maximum tolerance would be very beneficial in giving the user more control over this function.\\n\\n### Feature Description\\n\\nA current example for this function is the following:\\n\\nWe only asof within 10ms between the quote time and the trade time\\n    and we exclude exact matches on time. However *prior* data will\\n    propagate forward\\n\\n    >>> pd.merge_asof(\\n    ...     trades,\\n    ...     quotes,\\n    ...     on=\"time\",\\n    ...     by=\"ticker\",\\n    ...     tolerance=pd.Timedelta(\"10ms\"),\\n    ...     allow_exact_matches=False\\n    ... )\\n                         time ticker   price  quantity     bid     ask\\n    0 2016-05-25 13:30:00.023   MSFT   51.95        75     NaN     NaN\\n    1 2016-05-25 13:30:00.038   MSFT   51.95       155   51.97   51.98\\n    2 2016-05-25 13:30:00.048   GOOG  720.77       100     NaN     NaN\\n    3 2016-05-25 13:30:00.048   GOOG  720.92       100     NaN     NaN\\n    4 2016-05-25 13:30:00.048   AAPL   98.00       100     NaN     NaN\\n\\nI am envisining a version where we could have\\n\\nWe only asof within 10ms between the quote time and the trade time but more than 2ms between the quote time and the trade time and we exclude exact matches on time.

To get them from the csv, we can set the same parameter in read_csv, and the original Numpy array will be returned.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease refer to tests in scripts/tests/test_csv.py to see how this is used.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease refer to the original issue for more information on the problem definition.\\r\\n\\r\\n',\n",

If the lists have different lengths, then the output doesn\\'t raise an error and is correct.\\n\\nIn an older version of pandas (1.5.3), it produced a list of same length, but containing repeated casts of string arrays\\n```\\n<StringArray>\\n[\\n[\"[\\'t\\' \\'e\\' \\'s\\' \\'t\\']\", \"[\\'t\\' \\'e\\' \\'s\\' \\'t\\']\", \"[\\'t\\' \\'e\\' \\'s\\' \\'t\\']\",\\n \"[\\'t\\' \\'e\\' \\'s\\' \\'t\\']\"]\\n]\\nShape: (1, 4), dtype: string\\n```\\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nSame as pd.array([list(\\'test\\')]) but with `StringArray` type.\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\n\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\n------------------\\ncommit                : d9cdd2ee5a58015ef6f4d15c7226110c9aab8140\\npython                : 3.12.3.final.0\\npython-bits           : 64\\nOS                    : Windows\\nOS-release            : 11\\nVersion               : 10.0.22631\\nmachine               : AMD64\\nprocessor             : Intel64 Family 6 Model 154 Stepping 3, GenuineIntel\\nbyteorder             : little\\nLC_ALL                : None\\nLANG                  : en\\nLOCALE                : English_Europe.1252\\n\\npandas                : 2.2.2\\nnumpy                 : 1.26.4\\npytz                  : 2024.1\\ndateutil              : 2.9.0.post0\\nsetuptools            : 75.1.0\\npip                   : 24.2\\nCython                : None\\npytest                : 7.4.4\\nhypothesis            : None\\nsphinx                : 7.3.7\\nblosc                 : None\\nfeather               : None\\nxlsxwriter            : None\\nlxml.etree            : 5.2.1\\nhtml5lib              : None\\npymysql               : None\\npsycopg2              : None\\njinja2                : 3.1.4\\nIPython               : 8.27.0\\npandas_datareader     : None\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\nbs4                   : 4.12.3\\nbottleneck            : 1.3.7\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\nfastparquet           : None\\nfsspec                : 2024.6.1\\ngcsfs                 : None\\nmatplotlib            : 3.9.2\\nnumba                 : 0.60.0\\nnumexpr               : 2.8.7\\nodfpy                 : None\\nopenpyxl              : 3.1.5\\npandas_gbq            : None\\npyarrow               : 16.1.0\\npyreadstat            : None\\npython-calamine       : None\\npyxlsb                : None\\ns3fs                  : 2024.6.1\\nscipy                 : 1.13.1\\nsqlalchemy            : 2.0.34\\ntables                : 3.10.1\\ntabulate              : 0.9.0\\nxarray                : 2023.6.0\\nxlrd                  : None\\nzstandard             : 0.23.0\\ntzdata                : 2023.3\\nqtpy                  : 2.4.1\\npyqt5                 : None\\n\\n</details>\\n',\n",
